# SummerIntern2023_D8AI

D8AI(https://d8ai.com/) is an AI solution provider in Taiwan that provides businesses with custom chatbots. As an intern in the R&D department, I developed 2 APIs for D8AI:

One of the APIs generates an Excel file of question-and-answer sets from a PDF of qualitative about the client. The pdf may include information on their official website, their workers' manual, and experiences from customer service. After running the API, an Excel of QA sets with 1Q to 1A would be created.

After a manual inspection of the quality of the 1Q1A data set, the Excel file could be put into the other API for an expansion on the questions. The API would generate questions based on the answer and question provided. The questions would either be based on a section of the answer that has not been asked or a simple grammatical variation of the existing question.

By creating the two programs, D8AI and its clients would no longer need to spend time coming up with questions one by one. Now, the program would provide a first draft, and workers would only need to make changes to the original document.
